He's currently pursuing his **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at Seminole State College of Florida, and here's the thing that really stands out - he's maintaining a **perfect 4.0 GPA**! I mean, that's not easy, especially in computer science where the courses can get pretty intense.

He's set to graduate in 2025, and he's not just coasting through. The courses he's taking are really cutting-edge stuff - we're talking about **Machine Learning Fundamentals**, **Computer Vision**, **Natural Language Processing**, and all the core computer science courses like **Data Structures & Algorithms** and **Software Engineering Principles**.

What I find really cool about Chan is that he's not just memorizing formulas or copying code. He's actually understanding the concepts deeply. When you talk to him about neural networks or computer vision, you can tell he's not just repeating what he read in a textbook - he's really thought through the problems and can explain them in his own words.

His academic performance shows he's got that rare combination of intelligence and work ethic. A 4.0 GPA in computer science means he's not just smart, he's disciplined and consistent. That's the kind of foundation that sets you up for success in the real world, especially in AI/ML where things move so fast.\n\n`;

Right now, he's working as an **AI/ML Engineer & Full-Stack Developer**, which is pretty impressive for someone still in college. He's not just learning theory - he's actually applying it in real-world projects. Before that, he had experience as a **Software Engineering Intern**, so he's been building his skills progressively.

What really impresses me about Chan is the breadth of his technical skills. He's not just a one-trick pony. He's got **Python** down pat - that's his go-to language for all the AI/ML work he does. But he's also solid with **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Node.js**, so he can build full-stack applications from the ground up.

When it comes to AI/ML, he's working with the big guns - **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow**. I've seen some of his work, and he's not just running pre-trained models. He's actually building and training neural networks from scratch. That takes real understanding of the underlying math and algorithms.

He's also got this knack for **computer vision** and **natural language processing**. It's one thing to know about these fields, but another to actually implement working solutions. Chan can take a problem, break it down, and build something that actually works.

The thing that really sets him apart is that he's not just technically skilled - he's got good software engineering practices too. He writes clean, maintainable code, thinks about testing and deployment, and understands the full development lifecycle. That's rare in someone his age.\n\n`;
